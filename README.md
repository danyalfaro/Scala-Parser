# Scala-Parser


The Scala Programming Language
"Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries." 
- From the official Scala website (https://www.scala-lang.org/)
